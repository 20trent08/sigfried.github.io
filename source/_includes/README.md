Supergroup brings extreme convenience and understandability to the manipulation of 
Javascript data collections, especially in the context of D3.js visualization
programming.

Certain data manipulation problems arise over and over again in
data-centric Javascript programming.
[d3.nest](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Arrays#-nest),
[d3.map](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Arrays#associative-arrays),
and [Underscore.groupBy](http://underscorejs.org/#groupBy)
([Underscore.Nest](https://github.com/iros/underscore.nest) for
multi-level groups) solve the most completely generic aspects of
these problems, but after using these generic tools, there is
often much work left to do to extract the desired information
from the resulting data structures.  In most cases where you
might use one of these generic utility functions, Supergroup will
save you some of that further work.
