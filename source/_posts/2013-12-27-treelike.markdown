TreeLike is an experimental tool allowing rapid exploration
of the contents and inter-relationships across the columns of spreadsheet or
CSV data. Use it to load any local CSV file.
It immediately shows the distributions of values in all columns, and by
laying out the columns in some nesting order, can show hierarchical
relationships between values across columns. When two columns have a
many-to-many relationship, the merge feature shows connections in both
directions, not just from parent to child. And parent/child
relationships can be reordered with one or two mouse clicks.

[Demo](http://sigfried.github.io/treelike/demo.html) (you'll need a data file, how about: [MySQL world data](https://raw.github.com/Sigfried/treelike/master/data/mysql_world_data.csv))

To understand what it does, you need to see it in action. This rough
demo video will explain:

TreeLike will be most helpful with files of between about 4 and
20 columns. It should be fine with at least tens of thousands of rows,
but it hasn't been well tested.
